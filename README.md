test-example-promise is an example demonstration of how promises work in action. An example here is that using the fetch() method, we take an image, then we take a blob of the image, substitute it as the src attribute, create an img element, and substitute it there. Here I tried the fetch() method, and the very concept of promises - the then() methods if promises are resolved or fulfilled, and the catch() method to handle promises errors in rejected status. I also wrote two examples - unchained promises (with each new variable in the declaration) and chained promises (with one variable, which makes the code more compact).
